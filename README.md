## Hello, I'm Kali Hale ðŸ‘‹

I'm pursuing my master's in Computer Science at UCSB, expecting to graduate in early 2024. I graduated from California Lutheran University with my bachelor's in Computer Science and a math minor in May 2022. I'm passionate about creating code that is useful to the user, understandable by future programmers, and easily upgradable where possible. I'm currently working on research projects at UCSB and some file management scripts for [Fast Forward Concrete Cutting](https://github.com/FastForwardConcreteCutting).
