## Hello, I'm Kali Hale 👋

I'm an undergraduate at California Lutheran University expecting to graduate in Spring 2022. After that, I hope to go to grad school for a master's degree in Computer Science.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Graduate school applications
- Finals
- LeetCode practice
- Summer Research presentation

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- C++
- Arduino robotics
- More about Linux

### ⚡ Fun fact:

Whenever you see `／(•ㅅ•)＼` in my comments, it's just a way for me to tell what I wrote apart from what anyone else wrote. I picked up the habit of marking my comments in a distinctive way from a professor during my first large group project and it stuck. I used to mark my comments with `<@` as an abbreviated version of an text emoticon rose until a friend pointed out it looks like a bird, so now I use a rabbit emoticon.
