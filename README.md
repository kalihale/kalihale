## Hello, I'm Kali Hale 👋

I graduated from California Lutheran University in May of 2022 and I'm currently pursuing an MSCS at UCSB.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Research projects

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- About homomorphic encryption
- Basics of computer architecture

### ⚡ Fun fact:

Whenever you see `／(^ㅅ^)＼` in my comments, it's just a way for me to tell what I wrote apart from what anyone else wrote. I picked up the habit of marking my comments in a distinctive way from a professor during my first large group project and it stuck. I used to mark my comments with `<@` as an abbreviated version of an text emoticon rose until a friend pointed out it looks like a bird, so now I use a rabbit emoticon.
