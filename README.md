## Hi there 👋

I'm an undergraduate at California Lutheran University expecting to graduate in Spring 2022. After that, I hope to go to grad school.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Graduate school applications
- Finals
- LeetCode practice
- Summer Research presentation

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- C++
- Arduino robotics
- More about Linux

### ⚡ Fun fact:

I started marking my comments for personal/group projects after a professor mentioned he did so in order to know who wrote which code. My "comment signature" is a rabbit because I have a pet rabbit ／(•ㅅ•)＼
